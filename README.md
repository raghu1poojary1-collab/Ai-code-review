A TypeScript-based tool for automated code reviews using Google's Gemini AI models, Anthropic Claude models (including Claude 4), OpenAI models, and OpenRouter API with LangChain integration for enhanced prompt management.

## What's New in v4.6.7

### Prompt System Modernization (#90)
- **~45% token reduction** on core prompts — saves API costs on every review
- **Standardized output format** across all 15+ review types (consistent severity scale, confidence scoring, finding IDs)
- **Updated to 2026 standards**: OWASP latest edition, modern security threats (supply chain, AI/ML, API, container security), current framework/language versions
- **Framework updates**: React 19, Next.js 15, Django 5.2, Rails 8, Laravel 12, and 10+ more

## What's New in v4.6.0

### API Key Validation and Project Configuration
- **🔑 API Key Validation on Startup**: Automatically validates API keys before running reviews
  - Live validation against provider APIs (Google, OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI)
  - Clear error messages when keys are invalid or expired
  - Prevents wasted time on reviews that would fail due to authentication issues
- **🔄 Interactive Key Recovery**: When API key validation fails, provides interactive options
  - Enter a new API key directly in the terminal
  - Switch to a different provider
  - Continue anyway (for testing)
  - Exit gracefully
- **💾 Project Configuration Storage**: Save API keys and preferences per-project
  - Configuration stored in `.ai-code-review/config.yaml`
  - Saved keys take precedence over environment variables
  - Option to save keys for future use when entering new keys
  - Secure storage with proper `.gitignore` patterns
- **⚡ New CLI Flag**: `--skip-key-check` to bypass API key validation on startup

### Configuration Precedence
The tool now follows a clear configuration hierarchy:
1. **CLI flags** (highest priority)
2. **Project config** (`.ai-code-review/config.yaml`)
3. **Environment variables** (`.env.local`, `.env`)
4. **Defaults** (lowest priority)

### Example Workflow
```bash
$ ai-code-review .

🔑 Validating API key for OpenRouter...
❌ API key validation failed: Invalid API key

Options:
  [1] Enter a new API key
  [2] Switch to a different provider
  [3] Continue anyway (review may fail)
  [4] Exit

Select [1-4]: 1

Enter your OpenRouter API key: sk-or-v1-xxx...

🔑 Validating new API key...
✅ API key is valid!

Would you like to save this key for future use? (y/n): y
📁 Saved to .ai-code-review/config.yaml

Continuing with review...
```

AI Code Review can now be used as a **library** in other Node.js applications! This is perfect for integrating code analysis into web applications, CI/CD pipelines, or other tools.

### Installation as Library

```bash
npm install @bobmatnyc/ai-code-review
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { performCodeReview, testModelConnection } from '@bobmatnyc/ai-code-review/lib';

// Perform a code review
const result = await performCodeReview({
  target: './src',
  config: {
    model: 'openrouter:anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet',
    reviewType: 'security',
    apiKeys: {
      openrouter: 'your-api-key-here'
    },
    outputFormat: 'json'
  },
  options: {
    maxFiles: 50,
    onProgress: (progress) => {
      console.log(`${progress.stage}: ${progress.progress}%`);
    }
  }
});

console.log('Review completed:', result);
```

### Advanced Usage

```typescript
import {
  orchestrateReview,
  createAIClient,
  getAvailableModels,
  validateLibraryConfig
} from '@bobmatnyc/ai-code-review/lib';

// Test model connection
const testResult = await testModelConnection('openrouter:anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet');
if (!testResult.success) {
  console.error('Model test failed:', testResult.error);
}

// Get available models
const models = getAvailableModels();
console.log('Available models:', models);

// Validate configuration
const config = { /* your config */ };
const validation = validateLibraryConfig(config);
if (!validation.valid) {
  console.error('Config errors:', validation.errors);
}
```

### Web Application Integration

Perfect for Next.js API routes, Express servers, or any Node.js web application:

```typescript
// pages/api/review.ts (Next.js)
import { performCodeReview } from '@bobmatnyc/ai-code-review/lib';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    const result = await performCodeReview({
      target: req.body.target,
      config: {
        model: req.body.model,
        apiKeys: {
          openrouter: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY
        }
      }
    });

    res.json(result);

```

#### JSON Format

When using `--output json`, the review includes a structured metadata object:

```json
{
  "filePath": "/path/to/reviewed/file",
  "reviewType": "quick-fixes",
  "content": "...",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-18T15:45:27.123Z",
  "modelUsed": "openai:gpt-4o",
  "toolVersion": "2.1.1",
  "commandOptions": "--type=quick-fixes --output=json",
  "meta": {
    "model": {
      "provider": "OpenAI",
      "name": "gpt-4o",
      "fullName": "OpenAI (gpt-4o)"
    },
    "review": {
      "type": "quick-fixes",
      "path": "/path/to/reviewed/file",
      "generatedAt": "2025-04-18T15:45:27.123Z",
      "formattedDate": "April 18, 2025, 3:45:27 PM EDT"
    },
    "cost": {
      "inputTokens": 12345,
      "outputTokens": 2456,
      "totalTokens": 14801,
      "estimatedCost": 0.0295,
      "formattedCost": "$0.0295"
    },
    "tool": {
      "version": "2.1.1",
      "commandOptions": "--type=quick-fixes --output=json"
    }
  }
}
```

This enhanced metadata makes it easier to track and analyze reviews, understand the context in which they were generated, and reproduce the same review conditions if needed.

## Configuration

### Customizing Prompts

You can customize the review process in several ways:

#### Prompt Templates

The tool comes with built-in prompt templates in the `prompts/templates/` directory:

- `quick-fixes-review.md` - For quick fixes reviews
- `security-review.md` - For security reviews
- `architectural-review.md` - For architectural reviews
- `performance-review.md` - For performance reviews

#### Custom Prompt Templates

You can create your own prompt templates and use them with the `--prompt` flag. Custom templates should include metadata in YAML format at the top of the file:

```markdown
---
name: Custom Security Review
description: A custom prompt template for security-focused code reviews
version: 1.0.0
author: Your Name
reviewType: security
language: typescript
tags: security, custom
---

# Security Code Review

Please review the following code for security vulnerabilities:

{{LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTIONS}}

## Output Format

Please provide your findings in the following format:

1. **Vulnerability**: Description of the vulnerability
2. **Severity**: High/Medium/Low
3. **Location**: File and line number
4. **Recommendation**: How to fix the issue

{{SCHEMA_INSTRUCTIONS}}
```

#### Prompt Fragments

You can inject custom fragments into the prompt with the `--prompt-fragment` flag:

```bash
ai-code-review src/index.ts --prompt-fragment "Focus on performance issues"
```

You can also specify the position of the fragment with the `--prompt-fragment-position` flag (start, middle, or end):

```bash
ai-code-review src/index.ts --prompt-fragment "Focus on security issues" --prompt-fragment-position start
```

#### Model-Specific Strategies

You can use model-specific prompt strategies with the `--prompt-strategy` flag:

```bash
ai-code-review src/index.ts --prompt-strategy anthropic
```

Available strategies:
- `anthropic` - Optimized for Claude models
- `gemini` - Optimized for Gemini models
- `openai` - Optimized for GPT models
- `langchain` - Uses LangChain for enhanced prompt management

The LangChain strategy is particularly useful for complex reviews that benefit from:
- Structured output with Zod schemas
- Few-shot learning with examples
- Chain-based reasoning

```bash
# Use LangChain for an unused code review
ai-code-review src/utils --type unused-code --prompt-strategy langchain

# Use LangChain for quick fixes with enhanced prompts
ai-code-review src/components --type quick-fixes --prompt-strategy langchain
```

### Separate Writer Model for Consolidation

For multi-pass reviews and report consolidation, you can specify a separate model for the final report generation. This is useful for optimizing costs by using a more powerful model for code analysis and a cheaper/faster model for report writing.

#### Using Writer Model

There are two ways to specify a writer model:

1. **Via Command Line:**
   ```bash
   # Use Claude Opus for analysis, Haiku for report writing
   ai-code-review . --model anthropic:claude-3-opus --writer-model anthropic:claude-3-haiku
   
   # Use GPT-4 for analysis, GPT-4o-mini for consolidation
   ai-code-review . --model openai:gpt-4 --writer-model openai:gpt-4o-mini
   ```

2. **Via Environment Variable:**
   ```bash
   # In your .env.local file
   AI_CODE_REVIEW_MODEL=anthropic:claude-3-opus
   AI_CODE_REVIEW_WRITER_MODEL=anthropic:claude-3-haiku
   ```

#### Benefits

- **Cost Optimization**: Report consolidation primarily involves summarization and formatting, not deep code analysis. A cheaper model can handle this effectively with 10-20x cost savings.
- **Performance**: Faster models can speed up the consolidation phase without sacrificing quality.
- **Flexibility**: Use the best model for each task - powerful models for understanding code, efficient models for writing reports.

#### How It Works

1. The primary model (specified by `--model` or `AI_CODE_REVIEW_MODEL`) performs the code analysis
2. For multi-pass reviews, each pass uses the primary model
3. The writer model (specified by `--writer-model` or `AI_CODE_REVIEW_WRITER_MODEL`) consolidates the results into the final report
4. If no writer model is specified, the primary model is used for all tasks

### GitHub Projects Integration

You can sync GitHub projects to local directory for better project management:

```bash
# Sync GitHub projects to local directory
ai-code-review sync-github-projects --token <token> --org <org> --output-dir ./projects
```

### Available Subcommands

1. **`ai-code-review code-review [target]`** - Run a code review on the specified target (default)
2. **`ai-code-review mcp`** - Start the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server 🆕
3. **`ai-code-review test-model`** - Test the configured model with a simple prompt
4. **`ai-code-review test-build`** - Test the build by running a simple command
5. **`ai-code-review sync-github-projects`** - Sync GitHub projects to local directory
6. **`ai-code-review generate-config`** - Generate a sample configuration file

#### mcp Options
- **`--debug`** - Enable debug logging (default: false)
- **`--name <name>`** - Server name (default: "ai-code-review")
- **`--max-requests <number>`** - Maximum concurrent requests (default: 5)
- **`--timeout <number>`** - Request timeout in milliseconds (default: 300000)

#### sync-github-projects Options
- **`--token <token>`** - GitHub token [required]
- **`--org <org>`** - GitHub organization [required]
- **`--output-dir <dir>`** - Output directory (default: "./github-projects")

#### generate-config Options
- **`-o, --output <path>`** - Output file path for the configuration
- **`-f, --format <format>`** - Configuration file format (choices: yaml, json) (default: "yaml")
- **`--force`** - Overwrite existing configuration file (default: false)

Generate a sample configuration file:
```bash
# Generate YAML configuration
ai-code-review generate-config --output .ai-code-review.yaml --format yaml

# Generate JSON configuration
ai-code-review generate-config --output .ai-code-review.json --format json
```

### Environment Variables

All environment variables use the `AI_CODE_REVIEW_` prefix:

```bash
# API Keys
AI_CODE_REVIEW_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
AI_CODE_REVIEW_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
AI_CODE_REVIEW_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
AI_CODE_REVIEW_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Model Configuration
AI_CODE_REVIEW_MODEL=gemini:gemini-2.5-pro
AI_CODE_REVIEW_WRITER_MODEL=openai:gpt-4o-mini

# Debug Options
AI_CODE_REVIEW_LOG_LEVEL=info
```

#### Global Installation

When installed globally, you can use the setup script to create your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# If installed via pnpm
pnpm exec @bobmatnyc/ai-code-review/scripts/setup-env.js

# If installed via npm
npx @bobmatnyc/ai-code-review/scripts/setup-env.js

# If installed via Homebrew
node /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@bobmatnyc/ai-code-review/scripts/setup-env.js
```

The script will guide you through setting up your API keys and will place the `.env.local` file in the correct directory.

#### Quick Fix for Environment Errors in Global Installation

If you're seeing errors about missing `.env` or `.env.local` files when running the globally installed tool, use this quick fix script:

```bash
# Download and run the fix script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobmatnyc/ai-code-review/develop/scripts/global-env-fix.js
node global-env-fix.js

# You may need to run with sudo if permission errors occur
sudo node global-env-fix.js
```

This script will patch the global installation to avoid errors when environment files are missing and help you set up your API keys properly.

Alternatively, you can manually place your `.env.local` file in one of these locations:

1. If you installed via npm:
   ```
   /path/to/global/node_modules/@bobmatnyc/ai-code-review/.env.local
   ```

2. If you installed via Homebrew:
   ```
   /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@bobmatnyc/ai-code-review/.env.local
   ```

3. Or, you can set the `AI_CODE_REVIEW_DIR` environment variable to specify the directory containing your `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   export AI_CODE_REVIEW_DIR=/path/to/your/config/directory
   ```

> **Important**: The tool first looks for `.env.local` in its own installation directory, not in the target project being reviewed. This allows you to keep your API keys in one place and review any project without modifying it.

# Model configuration
# Specify which model to use for code reviews using the format provider:model
# The tool will automatically map this to the correct API model name
AI_CODE_REVIEW_MODEL=gemini:gemini-2.5-pro
# or
# AI_CODE_REVIEW_MODEL=openai:gpt-4o
# or
# AI_CODE_REVIEW_MODEL=anthropic:claude-4-opus

# Optionally specify a different model for report consolidation/writing
# This allows using a cheaper/faster model for the final report generation
AI_CODE_REVIEW_WRITER_MODEL=openai:gpt-4o-mini

# See the Supported Models section for all available models and their API mappings

# Custom context files
# Comma-separated list of file paths to include as context for the code review
AI_CODE_REVIEW_CONTEXT=README.md,docs/architecture.md,src/types.ts

# See the Supported Models section below for all available models
```

> Note: For backward compatibility, the tool also supports the old `CODE_REVIEW` prefix for environment variables, but the `AI_CODE_REVIEW` prefix is recommended.

## Supported Models

### Model Mapping System

The tool uses a centralized model mapping system that automatically converts user-friendly model names to provider-specific API formats. This ensures that you can use consistent model names across different providers without worrying about the specific API requirements of each provider.

For example, when you specify `anthropic:claude-3-opus` as your model, the tool automatically maps this to the correct API model name `claude-3-opus-20240229` when making requests to the Anthropic API.

The model mapping system provides the following benefits:

- **Consistent Model Names**: Use the same model naming convention across all providers
- **Automatic API Format Conversion**: No need to remember provider-specific model formats
- **Centralized Configuration**: All model mappings are defined in a single location for easy maintenance
- **Extensible**: New models can be added easily without changing the core code

You can see all available models and their mappings by running `ai-code-review --listmodels`.

### Extending the Model Mapping System

If you need to add support for a new model or update an existing model mapping, you can modify the `MODEL_MAP` in `src/clients/utils/modelMaps.ts`. The model mapping system uses a simple key-value structure where the key is the user-friendly model name (e.g., `anthropic:claude-3-opus`) and the value contains the API-specific details:

```typescript
export const MODEL_MAP: Record<string, ModelMapping> = {
  'anthropic:claude-3-opus': {
    apiName: 'claude-3-opus-20240229',  // The actual API model name
    displayName: 'Claude 3 Opus',       // Human-readable name
    provider: 'anthropic',              // Provider identifier
    contextWindow: 200000,              // Context window size in tokens
    description: 'Claude 3 Opus - Anthropic\'s most powerful model',
    apiKeyEnvVar: 'AI_CODE_REVIEW_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'  // Required API key
  },
  // Add more models here...
};
```

After adding a new model mapping, you can use it by setting the `AI_CODE_REVIEW_MODEL` environment variable to the new model key.

### Model Mapping Utility Functions

The model mapping system provides several utility functions that you can use in your code:

```typescript
// Get the API name for a model key
const apiName = getApiNameFromKey('anthropic:claude-3-opus');
// Returns: 'claude-3-opus-20240229'

// Get the full model mapping
const modelMapping = getModelMapping('anthropic:claude-3-opus');
// Returns: { apiName: 'claude-3-opus-20240229', displayName: 'Claude 3 Opus', ... }

// Get all models for a provider
const anthropicModels = getModelsByProvider('anthropic');
// Returns: ['anthropic:claude-3-opus', 'anthropic:claude-3-sonnet', ...]

// Parse a model string
const { provider, modelName } = parseModelString('anthropic:claude-3-opus');
// Returns: { provider: 'anthropic', modelName: 'claude-3-opus' }

// Get the full model key from provider and model name
const fullModelKey = getFullModelKey('anthropic', 'claude-3-opus');
// Returns: 'anthropic:claude-3-opus'
```

These utility functions make it easy to work with the model mapping system in your code.

## AI-Generated Code Detection

The tool includes advanced AI detection capabilities specifically designed for coding test evaluations and hiring assessments. This feature analyzes code submissions to identify patterns that suggest AI assistance, helping maintain the integrity of technical assessments.

### How AI Detection Works

The AI detection system uses a multi-analyzer approach that examines various aspects of code submissions:

1. **Git History Analysis**: Examines commit patterns, timing, and message structures that may indicate AI-generated content
2. **Documentation Analysis**: Analyzes README files, comments, and documentation for AI-typical patterns and structures
3. **Structural Analysis**: *[Future]* Evaluates code organization, naming conventions, and architectural patterns
4. **Statistical Analysis**: *[Future]* Performs linguistic analysis of variable names, comments, and coding style
5. **Linguistic Analysis**: *[Future]* Analyzes natural language patterns in comments and documentation

### Using AI Detection

#### Basic AI Detection

```bash
# Enable AI detection for coding tests
ai-code-review ./candidate-submission --type coding-test --enable-ai-detection

# Use AI detection with custom confidence threshold
ai-code-review ./submission --type coding-test \
  --enable-ai-detection \
  --ai-detection-threshold 0.8
```

#### Advanced Configuration

```bash
# Specify which analyzers to use
ai-code-review ./submission --type coding-test \
  --enable-ai-detection \
  --ai-detection-analyzers git,documentation \
  --ai-detection-threshold 0.7

# Fail evaluation automatically if AI is detected
ai-code-review ./submission --type coding-test \
  --enable-ai-detection \
  --ai-detection-fail-on-detection

# Include detailed AI detection results in report
ai-code-review ./submission --type coding-test \

  --enable-ai-detection \
  --ai-detection-analyzers git,documentation,structural
```

### Integration Examples

#### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
name: Code Review with AI Detection
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  ai-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Important for git history analysis
      
      - name: AI Code Review with Detection
        run: |
          npx @bobmatnyc/ai-code-review ./src \
            --type coding-test \
            --enable-ai-detection \
            --ai-detection-threshold 0.8 \
            --format json \
            --output ai-review-results.json
      
      - name: Check AI Detection Results
        run: |
          if grep -q '"isAIGenerated": true' ai-review-results.json; then
            echo "::warning::AI-generated code detected"
            exit 1
          fi
```

#### Batch Processing

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Process multiple candidate submissions

for submission in ./candidates/*/; do
  candidate=$(basename "$submission")
  echo "Analyzing $candidate..."
  
  ai-code-review "$submission" \
    --type coding-test \
    --enable-ai-detection \
    --ai-detection-threshold 0.7 \
    --format json \
    --output "results/${candidate}-analysis.json"
done

# Generate summary report
echo "Generating summary report..."
node scripts/generate-summary-report.js results/
```

### Security and Privacy Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: AI detection analysis is performed locally; no code is sent to external services
- **False Positives**: Always verify high-confidence detections through additional assessment methods
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure AI detection usage complies with local employment and education laws
- **Transparency**: Consider disclosing AI detection usage to candidates and students

### Supported File Types

AI detection works best with:
- Git repositories with commit history
- Projects with README files and documentation
- Standard project structures (package.json, etc.)
- Multiple file types for comprehensive analysis

## Code Tracing for Unused Code Detection

The tool includes a powerful code tracing feature for identifying unused code with high confidence. This feature uses a multi-pass approach to analyze code dependencies and references, providing detailed evidence for each element identified as unused.

### How Code Tracing Works

The code tracing feature follows a comprehensive approach:

1. **Entry Point & Dependency Mapping**: Identifies all entry points to the codebase and maps module dependencies
2. **Reference Tracing**: Finds all references to each code element throughout the codebase
3. **Verification & Confidence Assessment**: Evaluates evidence and assigns confidence levels (high, medium, low)

### Using Code Tracing

To enable code tracing:

```bash
# Basic unused code detection
ai-code-review src --type unused-code

# Enhanced detection with deep code tracing
ai-code-review src --type unused-code --trace-code
```

### Code Tracing Benefits

- **High Confidence Detection**: Thorough evidence collection ensures recommendations are reliable
- **Detailed Evidence**: Each element includes complete evidence chain showing why it's unused
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates potential risks of removing each element
- **Removal Scripts**: Automatically generates scripts for safely removing unused code
- **Edge Case Detection**: Considers special cases like dynamic imports and reflection patterns

### Confidence Levels

Code tracing assigns confidence levels to each finding:

- **High**: Clear evidence the element is never referenced (safe to remove)
- **Medium**: Likely unused but with some uncertainty (verify before removing)
- **Low**: Possibly unused but with significant uncertainty (requires further investigation)

## Testing API Connections

You can test your API connections to verify that your API keys are valid and working correctly:

```bash
# Test the configured model
ai-code-review test-model

# Test a specific model
ai-code-review test-model --model anthropic:claude-4-sonnet

# Test API connections before running a review
ai-code-review src --test-api
```

This will test connections to the configured API providers and provide detailed feedback on the status of each connection.
