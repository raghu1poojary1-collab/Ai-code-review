## [4.6.0] - 2025-12-17

### Features
- **API Key Validation on Startup**: Automatically validates API keys before running reviews
  - Live validation against provider APIs (Google, OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI)
  - Clear error messages when keys are invalid or expired
  - Prevents wasted time on reviews that would fail due to auth issues
- **Interactive Key Recovery**: When API key validation fails, provides interactive options
  - Enter a new API key directly in the terminal
  - Switch to a different provider
  - Continue anyway (for testing)
  - Exit gracefully
- **Project Configuration Storage**: Save API keys and preferences per-project
  - Configuration stored in `.ai-code-review/config.yaml`
  - Saved keys take precedence over environment variables
  - Option to save keys for future use when entering new keys
  - Secure storage with proper `.gitignore` patterns
- **New CLI Flag**: `--skip-key-check` to bypass API key validation on startup

### Improvements
- **Configuration Precedence**: Clear hierarchy for settings
  - CLI flags > Project config (`.ai-code-review/config.yaml`) > Environment variables > Defaults
  - Saved API keys and model selection persist across sessions
  - Model selection properly propagates through all code paths
- **Better Model Selection**: Saved model from project config now correctly used everywhere
  - Fixed multiple code paths that were reading directly from environment variables
  - Consistent model display in all log messages

### Technical Changes
- Added `src/utils/apiKeyHealthCheck.ts` for API key validation
- Added `src/utils/interactiveKeyRecovery.ts` for interactive prompts
- Updated `src/utils/projectConfigManager.ts` for YAML config support
- Added `updateCachedConfig()` function to properly update configuration singleton
- Fixed configuration caching issues in `ApiClientSelector.ts` and `openRouterClient.ts`

### Migration Notes
- **No Breaking Changes**: Fully backward compatible with v4.5.x
- **New `.gitignore` Pattern**: `.ai-code-review/` directory is now gitignored by default
- **Optional Project Config**: API key validation and project config are opt-in features
  - Use `--skip-key-check` if you prefer the previous behavior
  - Environment variables continue to work as before

## [4.0.0] - 2025-06-04

### Added
- **🧠 AI-Guided Semantic Chunking with TreeSitter Integration**
  - Real AST parsing for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Ruby using TreeSitter
  - Intelligent code structure boundaries preserving functions/classes/modules
  - AI-guided chunking strategy selection based on review type and code complexity
  - 95%+ token reduction (from 196K+ to ~4K tokens in typical cases)
  - Context limit problem resolution - no more 200K token failures
- **Environment Variable Control for Semantic Chunking**
  - New `AI_CODE_REVIEW_ENABLE_SEMANTIC_CHUNKING` environment variable (default: true)
  - CLI flag override: `--enable-semantic-chunking` for runtime control
  - Configuration precedence: CLI flag > env var > default
  - Debug logging for chunking decisions and environment variable status
- **5 Intelligent Chunking Strategies**
  - `individual`: Each declaration reviewed separately (high complexity code)
  - `grouped`: Related small declarations together (utility functions)
  - `hierarchical`: Classes with their methods (object-oriented code)
  - `functional`: Related business logic grouped (feature-based code)
  - `contextual`: Preserves import/dependency context (complex dependencies)
- **Review Type Optimization**
  - Architectural reviews → hierarchical chunking for class structures
  - Security reviews → contextual chunking for data flow analysis
  - Performance reviews → functional chunking for execution paths
  - Quick-fixes → individual chunking for focused analysis
- **Robust 4-Level Fallback System**
  - Semantic chunking (TreeSitter + AI-guided) → Line-based chunking (500-line chunks) → Individual file processing → Emergency fallback
  - Graceful degradation ensures no review failures
- **Comprehensive Documentation**
  - Complete semantic chunking guide (`SEMANTIC_CHUNKING.md`)
  - Technical implementation status (`TREESITTER_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`)
