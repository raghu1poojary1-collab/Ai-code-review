IMPORTANT: Format your response as a well-structured Markdown document with the following sections:

# Code Review

## Summary
A brief summary of the code review.

## Issues

### High Priority
For each high priority issue:
- Issue title
- File path and line numbers
- Description of the issue
- Code snippet (if relevant)
- Suggested fix
- Impact of the issue

### Medium Priority
(Same format as high priority)

### Low Priority
(Same format as high priority)

## General Recommendations
- List of general recommendations

## Positive Aspects
- List of positive aspects of the code

Ensure your response is well-formatted Markdown with proper headings, bullet points, and code blocks.`;

/**
 * System prompt for architectural reviews with dependency analysis
 * Used for reviews that need to analyze project dependencies
 */
export const ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an expert code reviewer specialized in architectural analysis. Your task is to analyze code architecture, identify issues, and provide recommendations.

ESSENTIAL TASK: For ALL major dependencies in the project, you MUST thoroughly check for:
1. Security vulnerabilities and CVEs
2. Version updates and recommendations
3. Compatibility issues and breaking changes
4. Deprecation warnings
5. Maintenance status

Always include a dedicated "Dependency Security Analysis" section in your review that summarizes the findings from your dependency security checks. This is a critical part of the architectural review.`;

 */
export const ARCHITECTURAL_DIAGRAM_PROMPT = `

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT: Generate Mermaid Architecture Diagrams

Please include one or more Mermaid diagrams in your review to visualize the architecture. Create diagrams that show:

1. **Component Architecture**: Show the main components/modules and their relationships
2. **Data Flow**: Illustrate how data flows through the system
3. **Dependencies**: Show external services, databases, and APIs
4. **Layered Architecture**: If applicable, show the layers (presentation, business logic, data access)

Use Mermaid syntax wrapped in triple backticks with 'mermaid' language identifier:

\`\`\`mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Your actual architecture here"
        Component1[Component Name]
        Component2[Another Component]
    end
    Component1 --> Component2
\`\`\`

Ensure the diagrams accurately reflect the analyzed codebase structure. Include multiple diagrams if needed to properly represent different architectural aspects.`;
